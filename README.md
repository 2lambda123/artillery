# Use Cases

- **High traffic testing** - ensure your API, e-commerce backend, IoT service can handle high traffic
- **Pre-launch load testing** - building a new API or service? test it before launch
- **Continuous performance testing** - run load tests in CI/CD to stop performance regressions being shipped to prod
- **Profile & debug performance issues** - run load tests to profile & fix high CPU usage, extensive GC pauses, memory leaks, and misconfigured resource pools
- **Run smoke tests** - verify key API functionality on every deploy from CI/CD. Monitor production continuosly and alert when an API is unavailable or returns errors.

# Features

- **Multiple protocols**:  Load test HTTP, WebSocket, Socket.io, Kinesis, HLS and [more](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=artillery-engine).
- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc).
- **Load testing & functional testing**: reuse the same scenario definitions to run performance tests or functional tests on your API
- **Performance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (latency, requests per second, concurrency, throughput).
- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS, using any of the thousands of useful `npm` modules.
- **Integrations**: send metrics to monitoring systems such as Datadog, Librato, and InfluxDB
- **Extensible**: write custom reporters, custom plugins, custom protocol engines etc.

# Plant Some Trees!

We have planted [over 1,500 new trees](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio) with the help of Artillery community. That's a small forest! We're aiming to grow that to a *large* forest - we're thinking 100,000 trees would be neat.

If you've enjoyed using Artillery and would like to help us out, add your tree to the [Artillery.io forest](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio). üå≤üå≥üå¥ Feel free to drop us a line to let us know too! üíö
